## Methodology

Each report reflects a scoped manual review with a focus on:
- Identifying critical, high, and medium-risk vulnerabilities
- Analyzing trust assumptions and protocol logic
- Suggesting secure design improvements
- Ensuring clarity of implementation and intention

All audits are based on publicly available source code and commit hashes unless otherwise stated.
